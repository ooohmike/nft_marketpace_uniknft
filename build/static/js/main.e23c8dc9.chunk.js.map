The `key` key is used for the key of the route (It will help you with the key prop inside a loop).\n  6. The `icon` key is used for the icon of the route on the Sidenav, you have to add a node.\n  7. The `collapse` key is used for making a collapsible item on the Sidenav that has other routes\n  inside (nested routes), you need to pass the nested routes inside an array as a value for the `collapse` key.\n  8.
